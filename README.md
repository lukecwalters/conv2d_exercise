# conv2d_exercise
This repo demonstrates a python class `conv2d.Conv2D` leveraging the included C library to perform a tensor-multiplication style implementation of multichannel 2D convolution.


## Setup
This was developed and tested on OSX 11.2.3.  The shared library file at `conv2d/c/conv2d.so` is generated by running the build script at `conv2d/c/build` from within the `conv2d/c/` directory, or equivalently:
```bash
cd conv2d/c
gcc -fPIC -shared -o conv2d.so conv2d.c
```

## Testing
A simple example/regression test is defined in `test_conv2d.py`, and exercises multiple random samplings of kernel, stride, and input tensor configurations, and tests each case against an all-python reference implementation.

To execute run the following command:
```bash
python -m unittest test_conv2d
```
